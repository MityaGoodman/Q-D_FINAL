## Description and goals of the project
The project was to come up with a system for selecting seats in a carriage for RZD based on personal qualities, habits, characteristics of each passenger. We have implemented this system of seat selection with the ability to view potential fellow travelers, including in neighboring compartments, SV, reserved seat sections.

## Conceptual approach
As a conceptual approach, we used the concept of a digital twin. A digital double is a virtual model of a physical object. It covers the life cycle of the facility and uses real-time data sent from the sensors of the facility to simulate behavior and monitor operations.
Because we collect confidential data (such as passport series and number). then we carefully protect them and comply with Federal Law 152 "On Personal Data Protection".
